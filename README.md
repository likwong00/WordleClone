# Wordle Clone (React + TypeScript)

This is a small Wordle clone built with React + TypeScript + Vite.

Features:
- Uses a configurable word list (`src/words.json`) you can edit or extend.
- Configurable max guesses via the Settings UI.

Run locally:

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- This is a minimal implementation for assessment/demo purposes. It doesn't persist state between page reloads.
